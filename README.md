## Features

- User-friendly graphical interface (built with `tkinter`)
- No terminal usage required once it's running
- Real-time status updates as it tests passwords

## Requirements

- No additional installations required (uses built-in libraries like `zipfile` and `tkinter`)

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
2. Open your terminal or command prompt.
